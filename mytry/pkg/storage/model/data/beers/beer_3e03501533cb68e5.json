	"short_desc": "While Corona wins the marketing wars in the U.S., Sol is the winning brand in much of Mexico, despite not being a standout in any respect. You see the logo plastered everywhere and it’s seemingly on every restaurant and bar menu. Like Corona, it’s simple and inoffensive, but still slightly more flavorful than your typical American macrobrew. At its best ice cold, and progressively worse as it gets warmer.",
